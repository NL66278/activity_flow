This module concerns itself with activities and workflow.

The purpose is for organisations and/or individuals to be able to organise
their work, co√∂perate, make sure all planned work gets done.

Activities can be started and developed ad-hoc, or it is possible to define
activity-types that consist of well defined steps.

Activities can be assigned to groups or to individuals. There will be fine-
grained control on who can see, or change activities.

For further information have a look at the documentation.
